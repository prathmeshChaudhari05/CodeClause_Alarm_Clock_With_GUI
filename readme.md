This project implements a simple alarm clock application using the Tkinter library in Python. The user can set the time for the alarm, and the alarm will sound at the specified time.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5.x
* Tkinter library
* Winsound
* Datetime
* Time
## Features
* Set alarm time
* Display current time
* Alarm sounds at specified time
## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is stored.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:

```python
python alarm_clock.py
```
4. Enter the desired alarm time in the format `HH:MM:SS` and click the **Set The Alarm** button.

5. The current time will be displayed on the GUI, and the alarm will sound at the specified time.
